# opencv_gpu_vs_cpu

Compare speed of openCV algorithms on various platforms with CPU only and with GPU enabled.

Provide results in a spreadsheet.

First example is the Farnbacke optical-flow algorithm, comparing speeds of:

## jetson nano:         CPU
## jetson nano:         GPU-enabled opencv
## Acer Aspire-E5-576G: CPU
## Raspberry Pi 4:      CPU
